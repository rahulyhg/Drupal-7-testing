            <td>{{value.field_order_name}}</td>
            _none
            <td ng-switch-when="1">Submitted for quote</td>
            <td ng-switch-when="2">Quoted</td>
            <td ng-switch-when="3">Quote Confirmed</td>
            <td ng-switch-when="4">Cancelled</td>



             The confirm (or accept) and cancel (or reject) button should show for the end user once there is a quoted amount.

 

E.g.

 

-          If Order Item.Quoted Amount != “”

-          AND if Order Item.Status != “Quote Confirmed” OR “Cancelled”

-          Then show buttons Accept | Reject

-          If user clicks Accept -> Order Item.Status = Quote Confirmed

-          If user clicks Reject -> Order Item.Status = Cancelled

-          If Order Item.Status = “Quote Confirmed” OR “Cancelled”

-          Then show text (not editable) ‘Item Confirmed’ OR ‘Item Cancelled
